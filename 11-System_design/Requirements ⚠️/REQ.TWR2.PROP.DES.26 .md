NO - [The requirements do not conflict because they pertain to different types of cases. One applies to metallic cases and specifies they should be made from non-ferrous ductile metals like 6061 aluminum alloy. The other concerns non-metallic cases and emphasizes they should not be made from brittle materials. Therefore, both can co-exist without conflict.]

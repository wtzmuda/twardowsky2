NO - [The given requirement states that the igniter body should be made from materials compatible with nitrous oxide. This is consistent with all the compared requirements, which either specifically mention nitrous oxide compatibility (the igniter sealings, injection system, and contact components) or suggest a condition (corrosion resistance/protection) that does not inherently conflict with nitrous oxide compatibility. Therefore, there are no conflicts between these requirements.]

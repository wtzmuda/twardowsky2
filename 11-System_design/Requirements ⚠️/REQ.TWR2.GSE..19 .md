NO - [The given requirement specifies that the GSE should include a system for disconnecting the filling system from the rocket. The first requirement to compare to says that the interface should be accessible after rocket integration and when placed on the launchpad, which doesn't conflict with the given requirement. It actually provides information on when the disconnecting system should be accessible. 

The second requirement to compare to, stating that the filling system should be disconnected before starting the tank pressurize procedure, aligns with the given requirement of having a disconnecting system. No conflict exists because it's important to disconnect the filling system before pressurizing the tank for safety reasons, and the given requirement specifies that such a disconnecting system should be present.]

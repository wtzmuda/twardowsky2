## Description

The initial deployment event shall occur at or near apogee, stabilize the vehicle's attitude (i.e., prevent or eliminate tumbling), and reduce its descent rate sufficiently to permit the main deployment event, yet not so much as to exacerbate wind drift. Any part, assembly or device, featuring an initial deployment event, shall result in a descent velocity of said item of 23-46 m/s.

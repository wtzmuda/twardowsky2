Mission statement


NO - [There is no explicit in-revision between these two requirements. The type of the rocket engine (hybrid) shouldn't directly in-revision with the apogee achievement. However, fulfilment of the apogee requirement would be contingent upon the capabilities of the specific hybrid engine used, as well as other design and operational factors of the TWR2 rocket.]

undefined

NO - The compared requirements are identical, therefore there can't be any in-revision.

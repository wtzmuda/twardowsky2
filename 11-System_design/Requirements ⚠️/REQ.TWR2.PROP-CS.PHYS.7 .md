NO - [There isn't any conflict between the given requirement and the requirements to be compared. Both requirements revolve around the combustion chamber's ability to withstand or operate under a certain pressure (45 bar). The safety factor of 3 in the first requirement is a factor of safety, meant to ensure mechanical strength and pressure resistance. The second requirement does not contradict this, it simply specifies the duration under which the chamber must maintain this pressure. Therefore, no conflicts are present between these requirements.]

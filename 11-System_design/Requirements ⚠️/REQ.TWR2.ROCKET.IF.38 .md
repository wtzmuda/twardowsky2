NO - [The given requirement and the requirement to compare are not in-revisioning. Both requirements advocate for safety margins - at least 1.5 for all modules and at least 2 (or 1.5 if proven by tests) specifically for composite elements of the rocket. The increased safety margin for composite elements doesn't impede the overall requirement for all modules.]

NO - [The individual requirements don't conflict with each other. The first requirement talks about all modules of the rocket, requiring them to withstand expected loads with a safety margin of not less than 1.5. This encompasses all modules, including the composite elements. The second requirement specifies that the composite elements should either be designed with a higher safety margin (2) or pass a test showing they can withstand loads with a 1.5 safety margin. This provides an additional layer of requirement but does not contradict the first requirement.]

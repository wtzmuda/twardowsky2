## Description

All recovery system mechanisms shall be successfully (without significant anomalies) tested prior to the IREC, either by flight testing, or through one or more ground tests of key subsystems. In the case of such ground tests, sensor electronics will be functionally included in the demonstration by simulating the environmental conditions under which their deployment function is triggered. A link to all videos of the testing cycle(s) should be included in the final report

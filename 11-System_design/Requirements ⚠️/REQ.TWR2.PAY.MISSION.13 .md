NO - [There do not seem to be any conflicts between the given requirement and the other requirements. The first, third and fourth requirements are in agreement with the main requirement stating that the main deployment event should happen no higher than 450 m AGL with a velocity of less than 9 m/s. The second requirement also aligns with the main one as it exempts payloads that reach less than 457 m AGL from having dual deployment, which is already included in the main requirement's "independent recovery system", potentially covering both single and dual deployment scenarios.]

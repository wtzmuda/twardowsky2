NO - [The two requirements do not conflict with each other. The first requirement specifies when the payload will be ejected (at the apogee of the rocket flight) while the second requirement defines the manner in which the payload should be ejected (in a way that minimizes chance for collision with the rocket structure). They each focus on a different aspect of the payload ejection process and can both be simultaneously satisfied.]

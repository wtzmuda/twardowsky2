## Description

Rail guides should implement “hard points” for mechanical attachment to the launch vehicle airframe. These hardened/reinforced areas on the vehicle airframe, such as a block of woodinstalled on the airframe interior surface where each launch lug attaches, will assist in mitigating lug “tear outs” during operations.

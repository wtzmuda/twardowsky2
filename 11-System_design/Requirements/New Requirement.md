## Description

RF transmitter, receivers or transceivers are not allowed to be mounted externally. Any RF antenna should have either: "RF Window" for antennas mounted internally or at least two-sided antenna mounted externally to provide for full 360 coverage. [NOTE] Single antenna mounted on the rear-fin of a flight vehicle will be insufficient, since the exhaust flames are highly disruptive towards the RF signals

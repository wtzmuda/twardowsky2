undefinedYES - There are potential conflicts between the requirement of having both a swirl injector or showerhead injector in the same plug assembly and the requirement that an igniter be located in the plug assembly. Depending on the arrangement, there might not be enough space in the assembly for both an injector and an igniter. Also, the requirement concerning the showerhead injector hole diameter assumes a specific design that may or may not be compatible with the use of an igniter or swirl injector. [[11-System_design/Requirements/REQ.TWR2.PROP-CS.CONF.19 .md]] [[11-System_design/Requirements/REQ.TWR2.PROP-CS.PHYS.22 .md]]

A possible solution could involve designing the plug assembly to accommodate different configurations or clarify the design constraints of the showerhead injector and swirl injector so they can coexist with the igniter. Another possibility could be to revise the requirement about the igniter's location.

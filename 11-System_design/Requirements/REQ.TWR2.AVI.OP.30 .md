NO - [The given requirement appears to align with the compared requirements. The first compared requirement matches the frequency noted in the given requirement. The second compared requirement doesn't conflict as the specified drift for the sensor is within the acceptable range stated in the given requirement. The third requirement doesn't mention anything that would directly conflict with the given requirement either; the interchangeable usage of pressure and temperature sensors wouldn't affect the pressure sensor's resolution or frequency.]

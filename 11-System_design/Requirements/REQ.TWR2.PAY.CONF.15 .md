NO - [The first requirement insists that the payloads should not be physically interconnected with other parts of the launch vehicle when being weighed. The second requirement states that the functionality (presumably of the payload) should be independent of the launch vehicle's ability to deliver the payload to its highest point (apogee). Both of these requirements address different aspects of the operation (weighing and functionality), and they do not conflict with each other.]

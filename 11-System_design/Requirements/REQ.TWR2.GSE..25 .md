NO - [There is no direct conflict between any of the requirements. The system's ability to measure the oxidizer bottle's pressure in the given requirement doesn't contradict with filling a specific amount of oxidizer, having a working non-return valve, or pressurizing the tank with the heating system. All requirements could be incorporated in the design without causing conflicts.]

## Description

Combustion chamber geometry shall allow the Hot Fire test on Hefajstos test stand

## Source

TWR 2 propulsion


NO - [There is no direct conflict between the given requirement and the requirements to compare. The ability to conduct a Hot Fire test on a Hefajstos test stand does not inherently conflict with the needs for the combustion chamber to allow pressure and seal tests, to work stably, to be integrable with the rocket, or to withstand mechanical loads during flight. These requirements are all addressing different facets of the combustion chamberâ€™s functionality and integrity. However, the satisfaction of all requirements would need to be validated empirically.]

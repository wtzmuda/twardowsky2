## Description
RF transmitter, receivers or transceivers are not allowed to be mounted externally. Any RF antenna should have either: "RF Window" for antennas mounted internally or at least two-sided antenna mounted externally to provide for full 360 coverage. [NOTE] Single antenna mounted on the rear-fin of a flight vehicle will be insufficient, since the exhaust flames are highly disruptive towards the RF signals

# Conflict

YES - There is a conflict between the stipulation in the main requirement that RF antennas should not be mounted externally and the part in the comparative requirement that states that these antennas can be mounted externally on the airframe. - [[Requirements/REQ.TWR2.AVI.DES.39 ❌.md]]

A potential resolution could be to revise the comparative requirement to explicitly rule out external antenna mounting, in line with the main requirement. Alternatively, the main requirement could be altered to allow for external antenna mounting under certain conditions, if this is deemed suitable.

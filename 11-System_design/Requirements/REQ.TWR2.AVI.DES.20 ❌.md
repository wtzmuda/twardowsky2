## Description
RF transmitter, receivers or transceivers are not allowed to be mounted externally. Any RF antenna should have either: "RF Window" for antennas mounted internally or at least two-sided antenna mounted externally to provide for full 360 coverage. [NOTE] Single antenna mounted on the rear-fin of a flight vehicle will be insufficient, since the exhaust flames are highly disruptive towards the RF signals

# Conflict

YES - the given requirement clearly states that RF transmitters, receivers or transceivers are not allowed to be mounted externally. However, the requirement to compare indicates that antennas of internally mounted RF devices can be mounted externally on the airframe. This poses a clear conflict. A possible resolution could be clarifying and adjusting the policy regarding where transceivers and antennas can be mounted to ensure consistency - [[REQ.TWR2.AVI.DES.39 ❌]]

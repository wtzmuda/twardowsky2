YES - The deadlines for completing the required tests are different. One specifies the tests to be completed by May 1st and the other by April 1st. This discrepancy could lead to conflicts in planning and executing the tests.YES - The two requirements conflict in terms of deadlines. One requires completion of tests by May 1st and the other by April 1st - [[undefined]]. A possible resolution could be to unify these dates by either selecting a single date or by creating a date range within which testing should be completed.YES - The deadlines for the completion of the tests as stated in the two requirements conflict. One requirement states that the tests should be completed by May 1st, while the other states that they should be completed by April 1st. - [[11-System_design/Requirements/REQ.TWR2.PROP.VER.3  .md]]

To resolve this, it would be best to align the deadlines and choose one deadline that works best considering all project aspects.

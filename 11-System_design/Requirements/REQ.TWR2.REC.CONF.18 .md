## Description

All safety critical wiring shall implement a cable management solution (e.g., wire
ties, wiring, harnesses, cable raceways) which will prevent tangling and excessive
free movement of significant wiring/cable lengths due to expected launch loads.  Wiring shall be labeled or color-coded to allow easy determination of the subsystem
to which it is attached.

NO - [The requirements don't inherently contradict each other. The first requirement seeks to minimize the chance for collision between the ejected payload and the rocket structure. It does not specify any particular point of ejection. The second requirement stipulates that the payload should be ejected at the apogee of the rocket flight, which is the highest point, potentially a point where the rocket is moving the slowest and hence minimizing the chance of collision. Thus both requirements can coexist without conflict. However, the actual implementation must ensure that the ejection at apogee indeed minimizes collision chance.]

NO - [The two requirements do not conflict with each other. The first requirement specifies the testing procedure for the filling system, requiring it to be pressure-proof tested at 8 bar pressure with a permissible pressure drop of no bigger than 0.5 bar in 15 minutes. The second requirement is related to the sealants of the hydraulic system. It outlines that they must permit a procedure of filling and pressurizing up to 60 bar, with a tolerable pressure drop of 0.5 bar. This pressure and drop are within the parameters of the first requirement. Therefore, systems or procedures conforming to one of these requirements could reasonably be expected to conform to the other.]

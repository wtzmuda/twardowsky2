TWR 2 GSE/Alicja Kwitek


NO - [The given requirement states the procedure that the filling system needs to be disconnected before starting the tank pressurize procedure. The first comparison requirement sets a standard for when the tank feeding system is sealed after the filling system is disconnected, but it doesn't conflict with the given requirement because it doesn't dictate when the disconnection should happen. The second comparison requirement states that the GSE should have a system to facilitate the disconnecting process, but it doesn't affect the timing or sequence of the disconnection operation, hence, no conflicts are observed.]

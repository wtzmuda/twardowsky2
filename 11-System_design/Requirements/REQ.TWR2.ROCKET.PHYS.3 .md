NO - There is no in-revision as the dry mass (53 kg) is less than the total mass (80 kg), which implies that the total mass includes dry mass plus some other components. Thus, both requirements can be met simultaneously.

NO - [The comparison requirement is for a maximum dry mass of 53 kg, which is less than the total maximum mass requirement of 80 kg. This ensures that the dry vehicle will always be lighter than the maximum total mass, hence there is no conflict between these requirements.]

## Description

Control Actuator Systems should be designed to Fail Safe in any abnormal condition or during an active flight abort (if such functionality is implemented). This means disabling cold-gas thrusters, returning control surface deflections to neutral position, disabling thrust vectoring, or seeking to disable any control feature which will apply any kind of moment to the flight vehicle.

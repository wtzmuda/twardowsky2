## Description

Combustion chamber geometry shall allow stable work of engine (precombustion chamber)

## Source

TWR 2 propulsion


NO - [The requirements do not in-revision each other. The given requirement and others all deal with various aspects of the combustion chamber such as its functionality, ability to conduct tests, sealing under pressure, and integration with the rest of the rocket. None of these aspects are mutually exclusive or contradictory, which means all these requirements can be fulfilled without conflicting with each other.]

NO - All of the requirements listed are related to the quality, functionality, and compatibility of the combustion chamber. They should not conflict since each one addresses a different aspect of the design. Stable operation, integration with the rocket, and ability to undergo pressure tests do not inherently conflict.

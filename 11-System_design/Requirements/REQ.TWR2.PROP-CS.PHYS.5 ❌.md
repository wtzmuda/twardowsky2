TWR 2 propulsion


NO - [There doesn't appear to be any conflicts between these requirements. The given requirement pertains to temperature loads and duration, the first requirement to compare speaks to mechanical loads, the second one refers to pressure and duration, and the third one addresses testing. These specifications are dealing with different aspects of the combustion chamber's functionality and should not conflict unless specific material, design or procedures counteract.]YES - The time of work given in the first compared requirement (20s) contradicts with the time of work given in the given requirement (10s). - [[11-System_design/Requirements/REQ.TWR2.PROP-CS.PHYS.4 .md]] 

One possible way to resolve this issue might be adjusting one of the time frames to match with the other one after considering engineering constraints and the overall mission goals.

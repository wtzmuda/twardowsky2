## Description

Injection system shall allow oxidizer mass flow rate of 3.3 kg/s with initial pressure difference of approximately 2.5 MPa

NO - [All the listed requirements are compatible with the given requirement. The second requirement perfectly matches the mass flow rate specified in the given requirement. While the first and third requirements do not mention any numbers or rates, they do not contradict the given requirement either. The first speaks about the total mass of oxidizer and the third talks about pressurising the oxidizer, which doesn't necessarily in-revision with its flow rate or initial pressure difference.]

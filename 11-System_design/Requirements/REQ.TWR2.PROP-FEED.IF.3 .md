NO - [The two requirements do not conflict with each other. The first requirement states that the interface between the tank feeding system and filling system (GSE) should be accessible after the rocket is integrated and placed on the launch pad. The second requirement states that the GSE should include a system for disconnecting the filling system from the rocket. These two can coexist, as the interface can still be accessible even with a system in place for the filling system to be disconnected.]

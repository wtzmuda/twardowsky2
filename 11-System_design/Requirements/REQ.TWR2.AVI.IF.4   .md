# Conflict
YES - The requirement "The avionics module shall be constructed such that mechanical elements would not interfere with the electromagnetic signal" may conflict with the given requirement that "The avionics module shall be equipped with and umbilical cord, an electronic connection". The mechanical structure of the umbilical cord might interfere with the electromagnetic signal. This issue can be resolved by enclosing the umbilical cord within a shielding material to prevent interference. - [[Requirements/REQ.TWR2.AVI.IF.5 .md]]

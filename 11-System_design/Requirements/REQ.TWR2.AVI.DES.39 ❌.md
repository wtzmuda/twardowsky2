## Description

Any internally mounted RF transmitter, receiver or transceiver, not having the applicable antenna or antennas mounted externally on the airframe, shall employ “RF windows" in the airframe shell plating(typically glass fibre panels), enabling RF devices with antennas mounted inside the airframe, to transmit the signal through the airframe shell. (360 deg with 1 caliber length at each side, up and down, from antena mounting point). Differen kinds of RF antena mounting must provide 360 deg signal with no significnt dead zones

# Conflict

YES - the given requirement states that RF devices must employ "RF windows" in the airframe shell plating for antennas mounted inside the airframe. However, the compared requirement states that RF transmitters, receivers or transceivers are not allowed to be mounted externally, and should have "RF Window" for antennas mounted internally or two-sided antenna mounted externally to provide 360 coverage. The conflicting point here is about the use of external antennas - the first requirement allows them, the second does not. - [[REQ.TWR2.AVI.DES.20   ]]

Resolution: The requirements would need to be revised for alignment about the use of externally mounted antennas. An agreement about whether they could be used or not, and if used, under what conditions, is required.

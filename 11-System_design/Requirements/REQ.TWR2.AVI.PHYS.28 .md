## Description

The measurment system shall be capable of reliably measuring the pressure/temperature in the tank in the range of 1-60 [bar] and shall withstand maximum mechanical pressure load of 90 [bar]. It shall operate in range of temperatures (-40 deg Celsius to 40 deg Celsius)

NO - [There are no conflicts between these requirements. The given requirement specifies that the system should measure pressure between 1 and 60 bar and can handle up to 90 bar of pressure, which does not contradict the requirement for accurate pressure sensors during pressurizations up to 90 minutes. The specification about the sensor's drift is also compatible, as it simply adds detail about the level of accuracy required from the sensors. The temperature operating range also does not contradict any of the other requirements mentioned.]

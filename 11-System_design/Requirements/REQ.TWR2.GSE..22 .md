NO - [The first requirement is about the operational pressure that the quick couplers should be able to withstand, while the second requirement is about the material from which the quick couplers are made. They do not contradict each other. The pressure requirement can be met by a well-designed and sufficiently robust stainless steel quick coupler. The potential conflict could arise if certain materials were unable to withstand the required pressure, but there is no such information. As such, these two requirements are not in conflict with each other.]

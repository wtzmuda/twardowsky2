## Description

Propulsion systems shall successfully complete an instrumented (chamber pressure and/or thrust), full scale (including system working time) static hot-fire test. The test shall be conducted under the most realistic settings possible. Test results from horizontal tests, using flight components, are less optimum, whereas test results from test benches (not using flight components) do not qualify. (TBD with EuRoC)

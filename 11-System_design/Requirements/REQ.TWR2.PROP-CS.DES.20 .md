NO - [The given requirement specifies that the igniter should be made from materials that are either corrosion-resistant or protected against corrosion. The other requirements state that the igniter body and sealings should be made from materials compatible with nitrous oxide and that the injection system elements should be corrosion-resistant. None of these requirements conflict with each other, because it's possible for a material to be both corrosion-resistant and compatible with nitrous oxide. Hence, there are no conflicts between these requirements.]

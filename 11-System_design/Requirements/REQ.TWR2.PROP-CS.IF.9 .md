NO - All the compared requirements pertain to the manufacturing, functioning, and testing of the combustion chamber, and none of them seem to conflict with the requirement that the combustion chamber shall be integrable with the rest of the rocket. In fact, these requirements seem to support the integration of the combustion chamber with the rest of the rocket by ensuring that it is properly manufactured, can function stably, can withstand mechanical loads, and can undergo necessary tests.

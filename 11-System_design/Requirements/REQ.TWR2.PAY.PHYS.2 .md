NO - [The two requirements are about different aspects. The first requirement is about the payload mass and the second requirement is about thrust-to-weight ratio, which is a measure of aircraft's performance. There does not seem to be a direct conflict between the two unless the thrust generated is not sufficient for a payload of more than 4 kg. However, that would be a constraint on the system design, not a conflict in the requirements themselves.]

Combustion chamber body should be manufacturable in our workshop

## Source

NO - [None of the compared requirements inherently conflict with the ability to manufacture the combustion chamber within your workshop. The ability to manufacture locally often concerns the available materials, tools, and skills. The requirements listed involve the functional specifications of the design and do not specify a manufacturing process that might not be achievable in the workshop. Therefore, as long as the workshop is equipped and skilled to produce the specified design, there should not be any conflicts.]

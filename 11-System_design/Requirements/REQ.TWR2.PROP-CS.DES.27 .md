## Description

Injection system elements hall be made from materials compatible with nitrous oxide

TWR 2 propulsion


NO - [All the requirements state that the specific components of the system need to be compatible with nitrous oxide. Additionally, the requirement that injection system elements shall be made from corrosion resistant materials does not in-revision with the given requirement, as corrosion-resistant materials could still be compatible with nitrous oxide. Therefore, there is no conflict between the stated requirements.]

NO - [All requirements state that the materials used in the injection system should be compatible with nitrous oxide. There is another requirement that the materials should also be corrosion resistant. There is no conflict between these requirements, unless a material that is compatible with nitrous oxide is not corrosion resistant. However, this is not specified, so no conflict can be determined based on the information provided.]

## Description

Combustion chamber shall withstand mechanical loads during flight

## Source

TWR 2 propulsion


NO - [All the requirements listed can be coherently met without causing any conflicts. Allowing pressure and seal tests on the combustion chamber does not restrict its ability to withstand mechanical loads during flight. The requirement for the combustion chamber to be integrated with the rest of the rocket is compatible with it having to withstand mechanical loads. The insulation allowing the combustion chamber to withstand certain temperature loads is also a requirement that adds to its durability and functional criteria, and does not conflict with the mechanical load requirement. Lastly, the tank needing to withstand mechanical loads does not interfere with the combustion chamber's ability to do the same.]

NO - [There doesn't appear to be any conflict between the requirements. The first requirement specifies the material to be used: stainless steel. The second one states a functional requirement: couplers should be able to separate under pressure of 60 bar. Both could potentially be satisfied simultaneously if a stainless steel coupler is capable of meeting the pressure requirement.]

NO - [Both requirements state that the launch vehicles should nominally launch at an elevation angle of 84°±1°. The given requirement also specifies that the launch rails should not permit launch at angles either greater than the nominal elevation or lower than 70°. The compared requirement mentions that competition officials may require certain vehicles' launch elevation be as low as 70° if flight safety issues are identified, which is still within the permissible range outlined in the given requirement.]

NO - [The two requirements do not conflict but rather complement each other. Both require a nominal launch angle of 84°±1°, while reserving the possibility that the launch angle may be decreased to 70° under certain conditions as determined by competition officials.]

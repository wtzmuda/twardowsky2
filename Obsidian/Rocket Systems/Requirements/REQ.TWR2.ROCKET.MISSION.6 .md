NO - [All the requirements seem to be in agreement with the given requirements. The first comparison requirement states a minimum apogee, which does not conflict with the maximum apogee set in the given requirement. The second comparison requirement's range also falls under the given maximum apogee. The third comparison requirement about the maximum velocity does not reference the apogee and hence is not in direct conflict with the given apogee requirement.]

NO - [There are no in-revisions between these two requirements. The "maximum dry mass" being no more than 53 kg and the "maximum total mass" being no more than 80 kg can both coexist under these terms. The dry mass could conceivably be part of the total mass, so if the dry mass falls under 53 kg, it would indeed be also part of a total mass that should not exceed 80 kg.]

NO - [The given requirement directly matches one of the requirements to compare to. The other requirement to compare to mentions 'total mass,' and it is larger than the 'dry mass' limit, so these are also consistent and do not conflict.]

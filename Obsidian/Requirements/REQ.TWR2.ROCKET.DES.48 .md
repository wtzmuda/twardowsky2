## Description

Airframe joints which implement "coupling tubes" should be designed such that the coupling tube extends no less than one body calibre (1D) on either side of the joint — measured from the separation plane. This rule applies both for “half” couplings (e.g., nosecone – body tube/coupling tube) as well as for “full” couplings (e.g., body tube – coupling tube – body tube)

## Description

Launch vehicles shall implement redundant recovery system electronics, including sensors/flight computers and "electric initiators" â€” assuring initiation by a backup system, with a separate power supply (i.e., battery), if the primary system fails. In this context, electric initiators are the devices energized by the sensor electronics, which then initiates some other mechanical or chemical energy release, to deploy its portion of the recovery system (i.e., electric matches, nichrome wire, flash bulbs, etc.).

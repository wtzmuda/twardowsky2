NO - [The requirements do not conflict because they pertain to different testing conditions and pressures. The first requirement refers to a leakage test at 8 bar, the second to a pressure proof test at 90 bar, and the third to a filling and pressurization procedure at a max of 60 bar. Each requirement has the same allowable pressure drop of less than 0.5 bar, but this value is not in conflict across the different conditions and pressures.]

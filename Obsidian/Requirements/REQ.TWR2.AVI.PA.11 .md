## Description

Wiring shall incorporate strain relief at all connections/terminals to prevent
unintentional de-mating/disconnection due to expected launch loads transferred into wiring/cables at physical interfaces.

NO - Both requirements are addressing similar concerns related to managing the physical stress and organization of wiring during launch loads. The first emphasizes the need for strain relief at all connection points, while the second focuses on the need for a cable management solution to prevent tangling and too much free movement. Plus, it also speaks about labeling or color-coding the wiring for easy identification, which does not in-revision with the first requirement. Therefore, the requirements are complementary, not conflicting.

NO - There are no conflicts between the given requirement and the requirements to compare. Both requirements aim to secure the wiring/cables against unintentional disconnections or displacement during the expected launch loads. The first requirement specifies the need for strain relief, while the second expands on this by requiring a cable management solution such as wire ties or harnesses and color-coding or labeling for easy identification. Both provide complementary methods of ensuring wiring/cable stability during launch.

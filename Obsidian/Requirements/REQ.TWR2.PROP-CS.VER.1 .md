## Description

During pressure proof test conditions (90 bar for 180 minutes) the maximum allowable pressure drop is less than 0.5 bar

NO - [The requirements do not conflict as the pressure thresholds, durations and the tolerances for pressure drops are consistent across the tests. Additionally, the pressure sensor requirement, mentioning that the sensor's drift should be smaller than 0.5 bar in 180 minutes, aligns with the allowable pressure drop mentioned in the testing conditions. Therefore, the requirements complement each other without any contradictions.]

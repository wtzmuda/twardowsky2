## Description

Main valve design shall allow controlled release of working gases

## Source

TWR 2 propulsion


NO - [The two requirements can coexist without conflict. The valve design that allows a controlled release of gas and the inclusion of redundant pyrotechnic primes are not mutually exclusive. Incorporating at least two redundant pyrotechnic primes is about safety and reliability, while controlled release is about functionality. Hence, no conflict exists as both requirements can be implemented in the design.]
